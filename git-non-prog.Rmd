# Motivation: Computational Reproducibility

    Clarebout Principle:
    </br></br>
    “An article about computational science in a scientific publication is not the scholarship itself, it’s merely scholarship advertisement. The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures.”

# Git/Github for Version Control 
.font150[
<br>
- Version Control Software are an increasingly popular tool for computational reproducibility

- Git and Github are VCS to track the complete history of your files.   

- They are very popular among programmers, but not so much among non-programmers. 

- Why? I believe it has to do with GUIs.

]

# What is a GUI and why the bad reputation

.font150[
<br><br>
**G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface   

- For most of us (non-programmers): *GUI = Software*.  

- GUIs are behind the popularization of personal computers. 

- Unfortunately GUIs are pretty bad at keeping a record of actions taken (bad for reproducibility).
]

---

# What is not a GUI?

.font140[  

- Any software that is run in the command line (aka terminal, shell, bash, etc).  

]

![](Images/command_line.png)

.font140[ 

- Git was designed to run in the command line.

- Today we will learn Git **without** the command line.
]

---

# What is Git 1/2
.font150[
<br>
- Git is a software designed to track the **entire** history of the code of a project. 

- Designed originally for software development, it has gained important traction in the research community. 

- Main appeal: facilitates full reproducibility and collaboration. 

- Git is mainly meant to work as a non-GUI (in the command line) software.   
**However:** most of the key features can be used through a GUI. 
]
---

# What is Git 2/2

.font150[ 
<br>
- By code git understands any type of plain text file (`myfile.R`, `myfile.do`, `.tex/.md/.txt/.csv/.etc`).

- This type of file can be understood as "human readable" as machine and human see the same fie. 

- Files that are "non-human readable" are called binary files (`myfile.docx`, `myfile.xlxs`, `.pdf/.exe/.dta/.etc`).

- Git can also detect changes in binary files, but it cannot show those changes.
]

---

# What is Github
.font150[
<br>
- Github is a company that provides two services (that we care of): 
  - A web hosting service for all our files track with git (public free/private $ or free if academic).  
  - A GUI software (Desktop App) that provides user friendly access to git.

- Others hosting ss include: Bitbucket, GitLab, Gitkraken, etc. 

- Other GUIs include: SourceTree, Gitkraken, Atom, RStudio.

# The Primary Goal of Version Control (for us)

.font150[
<br><br>
**The Goal:** keep track of any potentially meaningful modification to your code.  
]
--
.font150[
**Secondary Goal:** learn how to collaborate with others using Github.   
]
--
.font150[
**Bonus track:** get you excited about using open source statistical software (R, Python, Julia, etc)
]

# Strategy 1:  

.font150[
<br>
1. Agree on a naming convention with your co-authors (eg: YYYYMMDDfilename_INITALS).  

2. Begin working from the last saved version (eg: `20180325demo_FH.do`).  
3. At the end of the day, save on a new version (eg: `20180327demo_FH.do`).  

**Pros:** Easy adoption.   

**Cons:** Error prone, hard to document, lots of files for each document.     
]
---

# Strategy 2:  

.font150[
<br>

1. Name your file `filename` (ideally `01_filename`)  
2. Take a snapshot of your work every time you complete relevant change (day, hour or minutes).  
3. Update your entire working folder to the cloud.   


**Pros:** Error proof, seamless documentation, one file per document, track differences across all versions, meant to work with the cloud. 

**Cons:** Harder adoption.

# Demos

## Five Demos: 
<br>
.font140[

1 - **Simple but instructive.**   

2 - Repeat with branches.  
 
3 - Repeat with collaboration: pull requests.

3 -  First way to access content: download.   

4 -  What if you want to have your own copy of the repo? **Fork** it!  

]
---
# Demo #1: We move to our local computer 
<br>
.font130[
5 -  Now create your own repo. Initiate readme and make some edits.   

6 - **Clone** the repo. Explore the files and location.   

7 - Create new files, edit. And **commit**. Edit again, and commit again.   

8 - **Push.** Edit on github.com, and **pull.**   

9 - For this tutorial, best way to access previous version: explore in github.com and download.

# Five Demos 2/5: 
<br>
.font140[

1 - Simple but instructive.   
    *Review: def repo, github.com, download, clone, destination folder, fork, create repo, commit, push, pull, delete, search repo, download old version.*   

2 - **Repeat with branches.**  
 
3 - Repeat with collaboration: pull requests.   

4 - Repeat with collaboration: shared ownership.   

5 - Explore a real life repo.     
    ]
---
# .font80[Demo #2: Branches and collaboration (we wil be here a while)]
<br>
.font140[

1 - Create a branch from previous repo.  

2 - Add new content (do not replace), commit a few times, and go back and forth to the main branch.  

3 - Go back to main branch (master), observe file, merge.  

4 - Look at the history of the main branch.   

5 - Repeat 1-3 but now replace instead of adding content.

1 - Simple but instructive.   
    Review: def repo, github.com, download, clone, destination folder, fork, create repo, commit, push, pull, delete, search repo, download old version.  
    
2 - Repeat with branches.  
    *Review: All of the above, plus: branch, merge, resolve conflicts.*  
    
3 - **Repeat with collaboration: pull requests.**  

4 - Repeat with collaboration: shared ownership.     

5 - Explore a real life repo.

# Two formats of collaboration  
<br>
.font140[

- One owner, many pull requests.  
    - Easier to control, requires constant updating of forks.   
    
- Many owners, all can push.   
    - **Very** important to pull at the beginning and at before each push. 
]
---
# Demo #3: Pull requests
<br>
.font140[

1 - Fork repo [github.com/BITSS/test_birthday](https://github.com/BITSS/test_birthday), and clone it into your machine.  

2 - Edit fields of name, and birth date.   

3 - Save, commit and push.   

4 - Create your first **pull request**.   

5 - Let's see if I can manage all those pull requests very quickly (maybe illustrate issues).   

6 - Now find your neighbors repo of Demos 1 & 2, fork it, clone it, make a change, save, commit, and...

# Demo #4: Many owners

.font140[
    
1 - Half of you (\#1): go back to the repo of demo 1 & 2 and invite a collaborator.  
(Suggestion: the "forker" finds the repo, the "forkee" is invited  
, edits, commits,  and push/pull)

.font140[
4 - Switch and repeat 2 & 3: \#2 commits first and pushes, then \#1.    
]
--
.font140[
5 - Repeat 2 - 4 but now both of you in the same lines.

# Demo #5: .font80[Look inside a real-life project (and collaborate!)]
.font140[
1-  Find the following repo: [`github.com/BITSS/opa-wealthtax`](https://www.github.com/BITSS/opa-wealthtax).   

2-  Fork it and clone it.    

3-  Open it in your computer: `opa-wealthtax.Rproj` (needs RStudio), look around and execute 
`code/dynamic_doc/wealth_tax_dd.Rmd`.  

4-  Find elasticities at `rawdata/edits/research.csv``, modify one elasticity, document, execute again.

5 - Find `code/interactive_visualization/server.R` and in line `1561` change `red` to `blue`

.font140[

Some good habits:   
- Commit often (<1hr)  

- Always pull before you start a new session of work. Also good to pull before pushing.    

- Think of your remote as the most important set of files. Get used to deleting things in your local machine.
