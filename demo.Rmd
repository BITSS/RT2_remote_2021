# Introduction

The R package `bookdownplus` [@R-bookdownplus] is an extension of `bookdown` [@R-bookdown]. It is a collection of
multiple templates on the basis of LaTeX, which are tailored so that I can work happily under the umbrella of `bookdown`. `bookdownplus` helps you write academic journal articles, guitar books, chemical equations, mails, calendars, and diaries.

# Features

`bookdownplus` extends the features of `bookdown`, and simplifies the procedure. Users only have to choose a template, clarify the book title and author name, and then focus on writing the text. No need to struggle in YAML and LaTeX. 

With `bookdownplus` users can

-   record guitar chords,

-   write a mail in an elegant layout,

-   write a laboratory journal, or a personal diary,

-   draw a monthly or weekly or conference calendar,

-   and, of course, write academic articles in your favourite way,

-   with chemical molecular formulae and equations,

-   even in Chinese,

-   and more wonders will come soon.

Full documentation can be found in the book [R bookdownplus Textbook](https://bookdown.org/baydap/bookdownplus). The webpage looks so-so, while the [pdf file](https://bookdown.org/baydap/bookdownplus/bookdownplus.pdf) might give you a little surprise.  

# Quick start

Although this section might not be the latest version, the general idea won't change. Please see [R bookdownplus Textbook](https://bookdown.org/baydap/bookdownplus) to keep up with the update.

## Preparation

Before starting, you have to install R, RStudio, bookdown package, and
other software and packages (i.e. Pandoc, LaTeX, rmarkdown, rticle,
knitr, etc.) which bookdown depends on. See the official [manual](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) of
bookdown for details. Additionally, if you want to produce a poster, phython must be installed before using, and the path of phython might have to be added to the environmental variables for Windows users.

## Installation

```
install.package("bookdownplus")
# or
devtools::
  install_github("pzhaonet/bookdownplus")
```

## Generate demo files

Run the following codes, and you will get some files (e.g. `index.Rmd`, `body.Rmd`, `bookdownplus.Rproj`) and folders in your working directory.

```
getwd() # this is your working directory. run setwd() to change it.
bookdownplus::bookdownplus()
```

## Build a demo book

Now open `bookdownplus.Rproj` with RStudio, and press `ctrl+shift+b` to compile it. Your will get a book file named `*.pdf` in `_book/`folder.

## Write your own

Write your own text in `index.Rmd` and `body.Rmd`, and build your own lovely book.

## More outputs

By default, the book is in a pdf file. From 'bookdownplus' 1.0.3, users can get more output formats, including 'word', 'html' and 'epub'. Run:

```
bookdownplus::
  bookdownplus(template = 'article', 
               more_output = c('html', 'word', 'epub'))
```

## Recommendations

I have been developing some other packages, which bring more features into 'bookdown', such as:

- mindr [@R-mindr], which can extract the outline of your book and turn it into a mind map, and

- pinyin [@R-pinyin], which can automatically generate ['{#ID}'](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/cross-references.html) of the chapter headers even if there are Chinese characters in them.

Both of them have been released on CRAN and can be installed via:

```
install.packages('mindr')
install.packages('pinyin')
```

Enjoy your bookdowning!

## Models

Eq. \@ref(eq:mc2) is an equation.

\begin{equation} 
E = mc^2
  (\#eq:mc2)
\end{equation} 

It can be written as $E = mc^2$.


# Results

Fig. \@ref(fig:fig1) psum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. 

```{r fig1, fig.cap='caption', out.width='80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Tab. \@ref(tab:tab1) psum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. 

```{r tab1, tidy=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

# Basic Structure

- A header
- Text
- Code: inline and chunks

---

# Basic Structure: Header

```{r smpl yml, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
---
title: "Sample Paper"
author: "Fernando Hoces de la Guardia"
output: html_document
---
```  



---

# Basic Structure: Body of Text

```{r smpl_yml1, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
---
header
---
```

This is where you write your paper. Nothing much to add. You can check Markdown [syntax here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf). And it can use can type equations using LaTex syntax!

---

# Basic Structure: Code Chunks and Inline

```{r smpl_yml2, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
---
header
---
```

Body of text. 


To begin a piece of code ("code chunk"). Enclose them in the following expression (Ctrl/Cmd + shift/optn + i) 

````
```{r, eval=TRUE}`r ''`
here goes the code
```
````


To write inline use only one Back-tick to open followed by an "r" and one to close.

# Practical Excercise  Goals  


**Primary Goals:**  
1 - Become familiar with your first DD.    
2 - Compile an empty (or default) DD into multiple formats.   
3 - Edit a DD with some narrative, some code (in R) and some math (optional).   
4 - Present all the results dynamically into multiple outputs.   

\pause 

**Secondary Goal:**    
1 - Expose you to some R programming.   
2 - Entertain you with a fun problem.  

---

# Hands-on excercise: the birthday problem!

As an illustration lets write a report using the participants in this workshop to illustrate the famous [birthday problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem). 

>What is the probability that at least two people this room share the same birthday?

>There are `r n.pers` in this room. 

>Is it something like $\frac{1}{365} \times  `r n.pers`=$   `r round(1/365 * n.pers, 3)`?

---
# Create a new RMarkdown File

1 - In RStudio: `File-> New File -> RMarkdown...`  
2 - Name it, and save it as `/3-dynamicdocs/first_dd.Rmd`.   
3 - Review/edit the header, and delete all the default body of text except for one code chunk.   
4 - In that chunk define a seed (`set.seed(1234)` and number of people in the room (`n.pers = ?`).  
5 - Below the first chunk, write down a title (using `#`) and a brief description.

---

# The birthday problem: the math
Actually the math says otherwise: 
\begin{align} 
 1 -  p(n) &= 1 \times \left(1-\frac{1}{365}\right) \times \left(1-\frac{2}{365}\right) \times \cdots \times \left(1-\frac{n-1}{365}\right) \nonumber  \newline
 &= \frac{ 365 \times 364 \times \cdots \times (365-n+1) }{ 365^n } \nonumber \newline
 &= \frac{ 365! }{ 365^n (365-n)!} = \frac{n!\cdot\binom{365}{n}}{365^n}\newline
p(n= `r n.pers`) &= `r  round(1 - factorial(n.pers) * choose(365,n.pers)/ 365^n.pers, 3)`  \nonumber
\end{align}

---

# Code for the math (`/3-dynamicdocs/first_dd_solution.Rmd`)

Not relevant to look at: just copy and paste lines 23-30 from the solutions into your dynamic document (`first_dd_solution.Rmd`). 

```{r math, eval=FALSE}
\begin{align} 
 1 - \bar p(n) &= 1 \times \left(1-\frac{1}{365}
                                 \right) 
 \times ...
 A lot of equations using LateX syntax!
\end{align}
```

---

# Don't like math? Let's run a simple simulation!   
 1 - Simulate 10,000 rooms with $n = `r n.pers`$ random birthdays, and store the results in matrix where each row represents a room.   
 2 - For each room (row) compute the number of unique birthdays.   
 3 - Compute the average number of times a room has `r n.pers` unique birthdays, across 10,000 simulations, and report the complement.    


---

# Code for the simulation (`/first_dd_solution.Rmd`)  

```{r birthday prob, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
birthday.prob = function(n.pers, n.sims) {
  # simulate birthdays
  birthdays = matrix(round(runif(n.pers * n.sims, 
                                 1, 365)), 
                      nrow = n.sims, ncol = n.pers)
  # for each room (row) get unique birthdays
  unique.birthdays = apply(birthdays, 1, 
                           function(x) 
                             length(unique(x)) )
  # Indicator with 1 if all are unique birthdays
  all.different = 1 * (unique.birthdays==n.pers)
  # Compute average time all have different birthdays 
  result = 1 - mean(all.different)
return(result)
}
n.pers.param = n.pers; n.sims.param = 1e4
birthday.prob(n.pers.param,n.sims.param)
```

---

# Results   
- Many people originally think of a prob ~ $\frac{1}{365} \times N =$   `r round(1/365 * n.pers.param, 3)`
- However the true probability is of $p(n= `r n.pers.param`) = `r round(1 - factorial(n.pers.param) * choose(365,n.pers.param)/ 365^n.pers.param, 3)`$
- And the simulated probability is of  `r birthday.prob(n.pers = n.pers.param, n.sims = n.sims.param)`

# Practical Excercise #2: Mostly Harmless Econometrics!

There is a [fantastic Github](https://github.com/vikjam/mostly-harmless-replication) repo that is reproducing results from MHE 

Lets use the of examples Figure [5.2.4](https://github.com/vikjam/mostly-harmless-replication/blob/master/05%20Fixed%20Effects%2C%20DD%20and%20Panel%20Data/Figure%205-2-4.r) to show how dynamic docs can be used in data analysis. 

---

## Figure to reproduce  
![](../Images/autor_fig.png)

  
---

# Goals for excercise #2  

**Primary Goals:**  
1 - Demonstrate how the **entire workflow** of a study can fit into a DD.   
2 - Show how to add options to the header.  
3 - Demonstrate how a DD make code readable to non-coders.   

\pause 

**Secondary Goal:**    
1 - Expose you to some R programming.   

---

# Instructions to get started with excercise #2:

1 - Create a new blank `.Rmd` file (steps 1 - 3 in from previous ex.)
2 - Save it as `/3-dynamicdocs/Figure 5-2-4.Rmd`   
3 - Look at [this code](https://github.com/vikjam/mostly-harmless-replication/blob/master/05%20Fixed%20Effects%2C%20DD%20and%20Panel%20Data/Figure%205-2-4.r) behind figure 5.2.4.  
4 - Start building your own DD to describe what this code does. 

We will go step by step using `/3-dynamicdocs/Figure 5-2-4_solutions.Rmd` as back-up.

---

# Description

- Begin a new section (`##`), titled "Description"  

- Write a brief description of our goal in the DD.   

- You might want to insert a reference to the paper: [link here](http://economics.mit.edu/files/589).  

- Specific content not so relevant, just refer to "a treatment" and "a outcome".  

---

# Getting the raw data

- Begin a new section (`##`), titled "Raw Data".   
- Describe what you will do.  
- Create two code chunks:
````
```{r download data, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, 
warning=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE}`r ''`
here goes the code
```
````


---

# Cleaning the data

- Begin a new section (`##`), titled "Data Cleaning".   
- Describe what you will do:  
    - Restrict sample to years between 1979 and 1995 (inclusive)  
    - Guam from the sample (state = 98).   
- Create one code chunk:  
````
```{r data cleaning, echo=TRUE}`r ''`
here goes the code
```
````

- Add some description on the data (using dynamic reporting). See solutions (Figure `5-2-4_solutions.Rmd` line 58) for examples.   

---

# Build the analytic file

- Begin a new section (`##`), titled "Build analytic file".   
- Describe what you will do.   
- We need to construct the following variables:   
    - Log of total employment  
    - Normalize the year variable to 1978  
- Insert a new code chunk:

````
```{r analytic file, echo=TRUE}`r ''`
here goes the code
```
````

---

# Describe the model to estimate (optional)  

- Begin a new section (`##`), titled "Define model to estimate".   
- One line describing what we want to estimate (i.e. "We want to estimate a fixed effect model with lead and lag treatment variables").     
- A mathematical model that represents the equation to be estimated (look at solutions). 

---

# Vizualize the results (optional)  
- Begin a new section (`##`), titled "Vizualize the results".   
- One line describing what we want to estimate (i.e. "This estimates are then used to create figure 3 of the original paper, which is figure 5.2.4 in MHE.").  
````
```{r viz}`r ''`
here goes the code
```
````

---

# Practical Excercise #2  
- Run your version into multiple outputs.   
- Run the solutions version into multiple outputs.   
- Compare document with original version of the code.   

---

# Bonus truck: NBER Working Papers!
- Remeber the example from yesterday on the half bake analysis of NBER papers in github?

- Fork and clone the repo one more time: 
[github.com/fhoces/nber_trends](https://github.com/fhoces/nber_trends)

- Now knit the `.Rmd` file instead. 


---

# Final Remarks & More Resources
 - With DD we can achieve a one-click reproducible workflow.
 - This is particularly helpful to understand/present results that are hard to digest.
 - More great examples in the workshop repo (`x-moredynamicdocs`).
 - Want to learn more: [great free books](https://bookdown.org/) (can you guess how they were written?)

# Birthday problem  
What is the probability that at least two people share the same birhtday in this room?

Is is $\frac{1}{365} \times `r n.pers` = `r 1/365 * n.pers`$


## Analytical solution  

But actually when we compute the math. We get  an  surprising result: 

\begin{align}   
 1 - \bar p(n) &= 1 \times \left(1-\frac{1}{365}\right) \times \left(1-\frac{2}{365}\right) \times \cdots \times \left(1-\frac{n-1}{365}\right) \nonumber  \\  &= \frac{ 365 \times 364 \times \cdots \times (365-n+1) }{ 365^n } \nonumber \\ &= \frac{ 365! }{ 365^n (365-n)!} = \frac{n!\cdot\binom{365}{n}}{365^n}\\
p(n= `r n.pers`) &= `r  round(1 - factorial(n.pers) * choose(365,n.pers)/ 365^n.pers, 3)`  \nonumber
\end{align}


## Simulations  

1 - Simulate 10,000 rooms with n = `r n.pers` random birthdays, and store the results in matrix where each row represents a room.  
2 - For each room (row) compute the number of unique birthdays.  
3 - Compute the average number of times a room has `r n.pers` unique birthdays, across 10,000 simulations, and report the complement.  

  
```{r}
birthday.prob = function(n.pers, n.sims) {
  # simulate birthdays
  birthdays = matrix(round(runif(n.pers * n.sims, 1, 
                                 365)), nrow = n.sims, 
                           ncol = n.pers)
  # for each room (row) get unique birthdays
  unique.birthdays = apply(birthdays, 1, unique)
  # Indicator with 1 if all are unique birthdays 
  all.different = (lapply(unique.birthdays, length) == n.pers) # Compute average time all have different birthdays 
  result = 1 - mean(all.different)
return(result)
}
n.pers.param = n.pers
n.sims.param = 1e4 
birthday.prob(n.pers.param,n.sims.param)
```

Ok, I am convinced that the probability of atl least two people in this room share the same birthday is `r birthday.prob(n.pers.param,n.sims.param)`

# Git/Github for Version Control 
.font150[
<br>
- Version Control Software is an increasingly popular tool for computational reproducibility

- Git is a type of VCS and Github company that build on top of .   

- They are very popular among programmers, but not so much among non-programmers. 

- Why? I believe it has to do with GUIs.

]
---

# What is a GUI and why the bad reputation

.font150[
<br><br>
**G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface   

- For most of us (non-programmers): *GUI = Software*.  

- GUIs are behind the popularization of personal computers. 

- Unfortunately GUIs are pretty bad at keeping a record of actions taken (bad for reproducibility).
]

---

# What is not a GUI?

.font140[  

- Any software that is run in the command line (aka terminal, shell, bash, etc).  

]

![](Images/command_line.png)

.font140[ 

- Git was designed to run in the command line.

- Today we will learn Git **without** the command line.
]

---

# What is Git 1/2
.font150[
<br>
- Git is a software designed to track the **entire** history of the code of a project. 

- Designed originally for software development, it has gained important traction in the research community. 

- Main appeal: facilitates full reproducibility and collaboration. 

- Git is mainly meant to work as a non-GUI (in the command line) software.   
**However:** most of the key features can be used through a GUI. 
]
---

# What is Git 2/2

.font150[ 
<br>
- By code Git understands any type of plain text file (`myfile.R`, `myfile.do`, `.tex/.md/.txt/.csv/.etc`).

- This type of file can be understood as "human readable" as machine and human see the same fie. 

- Files that are "non-human readable" are called binary files (`myfile.docx`, `myfile.xlxs`, `.pdf/.exe/.dta/.etc`).

- Git can also detect changes in binary files, but it cannot show those changes.

# What is Github
.font150[
<br>
- Github is a company that provides two services (that we care of): 
  - A web hosting service for all our files track with Git (public free/private $ or free if academic).  
  - A GUI software (Desktop App) that provides user friendly access to Git.

- Others hosting ss include: Bitbucket, GitLab, Gitkraken, etc. 

- Other GUIs include: SourceTree, Gitkraken, Atom, RStudio.

# The Primary Goal of Version Control (for us)

.font150[
<br><br>
**The Goal:** keep track of any potentially meaningful modification to your code.  
]
--
.font150[
**Secondary Goal:** learn how to collaborate with others using Github.   
]
--
.font150[
**Bonus track:** get you excited about using open source statistical software (R, Python, Julia, etc)
]

# Strategy 1:  

.font150[
<br>
1. Agree on a naming convention with your co-authors (eg: YYYYMMDDfilename_INITALS).  

2. Begin working from the last saved version (eg: `20180325demo_FH.do`).  
3. At the end of the day, save on a new version (eg: `20180327demo_FH.do`).  

**Pros:** Easy adoption.   

**Cons:** Error prone, hard to document, lots of files for each document.     
]
---

# Strategy 2:  

.font150[
<br>

1. Name your file `filename` (ideally `01_filename`)  
2. Take a snapshot of your work every time you complete relevant change (day, hour or minutes).  
3. Update your entire working folder to the cloud.   


**Pros:** Error proof, seamless documentation, one file per document, track differences across all versions, meant to work with the cloud. 

**Cons:** Harder adoption.

# Two formats of collaboration  
<br>
.font140[

- One owner, many pull requests.  
    - Easier to control, requires constant updating of forks.   
    
- Many owners, all can push.   
    - **Very** important to pull at the beginning and at before each push. 
]

# Demo #3: Pull requests
<br>
.font140[

1 - Fork repo [github.com/BITSS/test_birthday](https://github.com/BITSS/test_birthday), and clone it into your machine.  

2 - Edit fields of name, and birth date.   

3 - Save, commit and push.   

4 - Create your first **pull request**.   

5 - Let's see if I can manage all those pull requests very quickly (maybe illustrate issues).   

6 - Now find your neighbors repo of Demos 1 & 2, fork it, clone it, make a change, save, commit, and...

.font140[

Some good habits:   
- Commit often (<1hr)  

- Always pull before you start a new session of work. Also good to pull before pushing.    

- Think of your remote as the most important set of files. Get used to deleting things in your local machine.

## Definitions 

### Terms  

- **Git:** is the software that does tracks changes across your files. All happens under the hood (there is no "Git app"")  

- **Github** is an implementation of Git that is easier to use, provides free (public) cloud service, and tools for collaboration.   

- **Github Desktop App** is software develop by Github that helps you run Git in your computer and access your work on the web.   

- **Repo:** A repository or is a master folder that contains all your work.   

- **Local:** when you make changes to your files in your computer, you are working locally.    

- **Remote:** whenever you make changes to the files in the cloud/server you are working remotelly.   

### Actions to get files

- **Fork:** when in github.com you copy the repo of somebody else's account into your account, you fork it.     

- **Clone:** when you download at repo into your local machine, using the github app, you clone a repo.     

### Actions to track files    

- **Commit:** whenever you take a local snapshot of your *saved* work, you commit. Get used to commiting early and often.     

- **Push:** when you want to upload a set of local commits to the remote, you push.   

- **Pull:** when you want to update your local repo with more recent content from the remote, you pull. 


## Pain points and (quick and dirty) solutions

- Not sure if you have git installed? --> Install the Github desktop app.   
- Having problem with authetification?  --> Install the Github desktop app and login.   
- Cannot pull or push due to merge conflicts? --> Back up local repo, then delete, then clone from remote.
