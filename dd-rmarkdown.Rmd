# Dynamic Documents For Computational Reproducibility
.pull-left[
.font140[

- Based on principles of *literate programming* aims at combining code and paper in one single document 

- Best framework to achieve the aspirational goal of **one-click reproducible workflow**

- Best two current implementations: `RMarkdown (R)` & `Jupyter (Julia, Python)`.  `Stata` is catching up (dyndocs release [here](https://www.stata.com/new-in-stata/markdown/) and reviews [here](http://data.princeton.edu/stata/markdown/markstat.htm) and [here](https://www.bitss.org/2017/09/05/review-of-statas-dyndoc/))

**"Bro-pen" Science Warning Ahead!**    

- Dynamic docs are useful, but they are not essential for reproducibility   
- They are pack with  little quirks that takes a while to master  
- Within DD 90% of the values comes from the most basic (default) output. All the other "cool and easy" feature can be not so easy and make you suffer from the "shiny new exit" phenomena

This is where you write your paper. Nothing much to add. You can check Markdown [syntax here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf). And it can use can type equations using [LaTex syntax](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions)!

Body of text. 


To begin a piece of code ("code chunk"). Enclose them in the following expression (Ctrl/Cmd + shift/optn + i) 

````
```{r, eval=TRUE}`r ''`

# Practical Excercise  Goals  


.font140[
**Primary Goals:**  
1. Become familiar with your first DD.    
2. Compile an empty (or default) DD into multiple formats.   
3. Edit a DD with some narrative, some code (in R) and some math (optional).   
4. Present all the results dynamically into multiple outputs.   

]

.font140[
**Secondary Goal:**    
1. Expose you to some R programming.   
2. Entertain you with a fun problem.

# Hands-on excercise: the birthday problem!
.font140[

<br>

As an illustration lets write a report using the participants in this workshop to illustrate the famous [birthday problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem). 

>What is the probability that at least two people this room share the same birthday?

>There are `r n.pers` in this room. 

>Is it something like $\frac{`r n.pers`}{365} =$   `r round(n.pers/365 , 3)`?

# Create a new RMarkdown File
.font140[

1 - In RStudio: `File-> New File -> RMarkdown...`  

2 - Name it, and save it as `/dynamicdocs/first_dd.Rmd`.   

3 - Review/edit the header, and delete all the default body of text except for one code chunk.   

4 - In that chunk define a seed (`set.seed(1234)`, number of people in the room (`n.pers = ?`), and this other variable:`n.sims = 10000` (will explain later) 

5 - Below the first chunk, write down a title (using `#`) and a brief description.

# The birthday problem: the math

Actually the math says otherwise. Define p(n) as the probability that at least one pair has the same birthday, then the $1 - p(n)$ is the probability that all are born in a different day. Which we can compute as:

.font150[
<br>
- Many people originally think of a prob ~ $\frac{1}{365} \times n =   `r round(1/365 * n.pers, 3)`$

- However the true probability is of $p(n= `r n.pers`) = `r round(1 - factorial(n.pers) * choose(365,n.pers)/ 365^n.pers, 3)`$

- And the simulated probability is of  $`r bp_sim`$

# Practical Excercise #2: Mostly Harmless Econometrics!


There is a [fantastic Github](https://github.com/vikjam/mostly-harmless-replication) repo that is reproducing results from MHE 

Lets use the of examples Figure [5.2.4](https://github.com/vikjam/mostly-harmless-replication/blob/master/05%20Fixed%20Effects%2C%20DD%20and%20Panel%20Data/Figure%205-2-4.r) to show how dynamic docs can be used in data analysis. 



  
---

# Goals for excercise #2  
.font140[
**Primary Goals:**  
1 - Demonstrate how the **entire workflow** of a study can fit into a DD.   
2 - Show how to add options to the header.  
3 - Demonstrate how a DD make code readable to non-coders.   



**Secondary Goal:**    
1 - Expose you to some R programming.   
]
---

# Instructions to get started with excercise #2:
.font140[

1 - Create a new blank `.Rmd` file (steps 1 - 3 in from previous ex.)

2 - Save it as `/dynamicdocs/Figure 5-2-4.Rmd`   

3 - Look at [this code](https://github.com/vikjam/mostly-harmless-replication/blob/master/05%20Fixed%20Effects%2C%20DD%20and%20Panel%20Data/Figure%205-2-4.r) behind figure 5.2.4.  

4 - Start building your own DD to describe what this code does. 

We will go step by step using `/dynamicdocs/Figure 5-2-4_solutions.Rmd` as back-up.
]
---

# Description
.font140[

- Begin a new section (`##`), titled "Description"  

- Write a brief description of our goal in the DD.   

- You might want to insert a reference to the paper: [link here](http://economics.mit.edu/files/589).  

- Specific content not so relevant, just refer to "a treatment" and "a outcome".  

]
---

# Getting the raw data

.font140[
- Begin a new section (`##`), titled "Raw Data".   
- Describe what you will do.  
- Create two code chunks:
````
```{r download data, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, 
warning=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE}`r ''`
here goes the code
```
````
]

---

# Cleaning the data

.font140[

- Begin a new section (`##`), titled "Data Cleaning".   
- Describe what you will do:  
    - Restrict sample to years between 1979 and 1995 (inclusive)  
    - Guam from the sample (state = 98).   
- Create one code chunk:  
````
```{r data cleaning, echo=TRUE}`r ''`
here goes the code
```
````

- Add some description on the data (using dynamic reporting). See solutions (Figure `5-2-4_solutions.Rmd` line 58) for examples.   
]
---

# Build the analytic file
.font140[
- Begin a new section (`##`), titled "Build analytic file".   
- Describe what you will do.   
- We need to construct the following variables:   
    - Log of total employment  
    - Normalize the year variable to 1978  
- Insert a new code chunk:

````
```{r analytic file, echo=TRUE}`r ''`
here goes the code
```
````

]

---

# Describe the model to estimate (optional)  
.font140[
<br>
- Begin a new section (`##`), titled "Define model to estimate".   
- One line describing what we want to estimate (i.e. "We want to estimate a fixed effect model with lead and lag treatment variables").     
- A mathematical model that represents the equation to be estimated (look at solutions). 
]
---

# Vizualize the results (optional)
.font140[
<br>

- Begin a new section (`##`), titled "Vizualize the results".   
- One line describing what we want to estimate (i.e. "This estimates are then used to create figure 3 of the original paper, which is figure 5.2.4 in MHE.").  
````
```{r viz}`r ''`
here goes the code
```
````
]
---

# Practical Excercise #2  

.font140[
- Run your version into multiple outputs.   
- Run the solutions version into multiple outputs.   
- Compare document with original version of the code.   
]
---

# Bonus truck: NBER Working Papers!
.font140[
- Remeber the example from yesterday on the half bake analysis of NBER papers in github?

- Fork and clone the repo one more time: 
[github.com/fhoces/nber_trends](https://github.com/fhoces/nber_trends)

- Now knit the `.Rmd` file instead. 

]
---

# Final Remarks & More Resources
.font140[

- With DD we can get closer to a one-click reproducible workflow.

- Helps to generate 95% of final output, but if you cannot customize your output 100% do the last 5% in the final desired output (word, latex, etc). 

- Large amount of great tutorials on the web (check out the [most recent one from RStudio](https://youtu.be/WkF7nqEYF1E)).

- Great examples: blog posts, and [so](https://bookdown.org/ts_robinson1994/10_fundamental_theorems_for_econometrics/vtDma6bZJ/), [many](https://admindatahandbook.mit.edu/book/v1.0/index.html), [books](https://bitss.github.io/ACRE/) (not many papers!). 

- Want to learn more: [great free books](https://bookdown.org/) (can you guess how they were written?)
